I appreciate your feedback regarding proactiveness and taking initiatives. I would like to provide some context to my approach.

In our sprint cycles, priorities are established during high-level discussions at onsite meetings, where we collectively decide on the focus areas and sprint goals. Additionally, after each sprint concludes, we conduct retrospectives to assess what went well and where improvements can be made. During these retrospectives, I actively share my perspectives on the sprint's performance.

In terms of task assignment, I take the initiative to assign tasks to myself rather than waiting for task assignments from others. This approach allows me to take ownership of my work and ensures that I am aligned with the sprint goals and priorities.

Furthermore, whenever I have bandwidth, I proactively explore industry-standard CICD practices and seek opportunities to enhance my knowledge and skills in this domain.
