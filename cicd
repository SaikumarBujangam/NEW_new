I wanted to update you on my progress in upskilling within the DevOps area and technology. Since joining this project, I have dedicated myself to learning and improving my expertise. I am proud to inform you that I have successfully upskilled in Terraform and obtained the Terraform Certified Associate certification.

Moreover, during our regular touch base meetings, I have mentioned my current focus on learning Kubernetes, a critical orchestration tool in the DevOps landscape. Given its importance and relevance to our project, I am eager to achieve Kubernetes certification to further enhance my knowledge and contribute effectively.

I wanted to inquire if there is any possibility of availing a voucher or reimbursement support from Wipro to help cover the costs associated with obtaining the Kubernetes certification. Your guidance and support in this matter would greatly facilitate my ongoing efforts to upskill and bring additional value to our project.
