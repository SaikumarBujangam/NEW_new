I want to confirm my openness and availability for on-call support over the weekends. I understand the importance of ensuring our systems run smoothly during critical times, and I am committed to contributing to the team's success by being on call when needed. Please feel free to include me in the rotation, and I will make sure to be responsive and effective in addressing any issues that may arise during weekends.
