I understand the concern about the lower number of JIRAs I've worked on in the last 6 months. It's worth noting that in our CICD team, each JIRA often represents a significant feature development effort. These tasks require considerable time and effort, including thorough testing and validation before introducing changes into our systems. Due to the complexity and careful attention to detail required, the number of JIRAs might appear lower compared to more granular tasks. However, I want to assure you that I am committed to delivering high-quality results, and I prioritize the thoroughness and effectiveness of my contributions
