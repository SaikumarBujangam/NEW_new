I want to share that I've been actively pursuing the opportunity to take on additional responsibilities related to creating code pipelines. I expressed my interest and willingness to contribute in this area on multiple occasions. After persistent requests, I finally received the necessary knowledge and access to start working on code pipelines.

I'm pleased to inform you that I'm currently actively engaged in building and managing these code pipelines. This experience has allowed me to further broaden my skill set and contribute to our team's overall efficiency and effectiveness.
