I appreciate the feedback regarding proactiveness and taking initiatives. It's important to note that our team follows a structured approach to setting priorities and goals. Every sprint, we have high-level discussions with Sandeep and Navneet to determine our immediate and long-term priorities. These discussions are instrumental in defining our sprint goals and quarterly objectives during our planning calls.

Additionally, after each sprint, we conduct retrospectives to evaluate what went well and areas for improvement. During these retrospectives, I actively contribute by sharing my perspectives on the sprint and providing valuable input.

In terms of task assignment, I have always taken the initiative to assign tasks to myself and work on them. I understand the importance of not waiting for work to be assigned and taking ownership of my responsibilities.

Furthermore, whenever I have bandwidth, I proactively explore industry-standard CICD practices to stay updated and aligned with the latest developments in our field. I believe that continuous learning and improvement are essential for delivering the best results.

I want to assure you that I am fully committed to enhancing my proactiveness and initiative-taking. Your feedback is valuable, and I will work diligently to ensure that my contributions align with our team's goals and customer satisfaction.
