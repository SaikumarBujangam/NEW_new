 understand the importance of making a positive impression in front of our clients. I would like to share that I have been actively participating in client meetings on a daily basis. I regularly provide updates, share my views on the CICD approach, and express any doubts or opinions during our huddles. In fact, I had a discussion with Sandeep recently where I shared a list of my proficiency items in the CICD area in which I excel. During this conversation, Sandeep also shared his plans to onboard additional resources at the offshore level and asked me to groom them in this domain, aligning with our teams growth strategy. I have attached the sheet I shared with Sandeep for your reference. As the sole member from the CICD Pipeline development team offshore, I am always committed to working on projects independently and will seek minimum support on enhancements or modifications, collaborating with onshore colleagues for their insights on more secure approaches.
