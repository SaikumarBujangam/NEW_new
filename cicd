I understand the importance of making a positive impression in front of our clients. I would like to share that I have been actively participating in client meetings on a daily basis. I regularly provide updates, share my views on the CICD approach, and express any doubts or opinions during our huddles. In fact, I had a discussion with Sandeep recently where I shared a list of proficiency items in the CICD area in which I excel. Sandeep and I discussed plans to onboard additional resources and groom them in this area, and it was a productive conversation. I have attached the sheet I shared with Sandeep for your reference. As the sole member from the CICD Pipeline development team offshore, I am committed to working on projects independently and will actively seek enhancements or modifications, collaborating with onshore colleagues for their insights on more secure approaches.
