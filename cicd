Hi Sai,

We spoke on different parameters with respect to your roles and responsibilities you are currently playing & future ask from you. Please consider these as a positive and constructive feedback and plan to act accordingly. Let me know if you have any disconnects. 

1.	Client feedback: It has not been very impressive and positive for you. You need to showcase your presence in front of customers. Right now, they do not feel very confident. Please actively participate in the meetings, drive things on your own with very minimal support & supervision from onshore folks. They need a person who can drive things on his own. 

2.	Responsibility and ownership: I feel there is scope of improvement for you. 

a.	Need to take additional responsibilities and ownership. Reach out to customers for additional and challenging work in DevOps area. Parallelly, you can take additional responsibilities at offshore in different technology being used in platform area. 
b.	Prepare for on call support over weekdays/weekends. 
c.	No of Jiras you have worked are very less in last 6 months. 

3.	Proactiveness and lack of initiatives: Need to be more proactive, this is expected from a person at your level. Do not wait for work being assigned to you, rather reach out to customers for more work, provide suggestions, work like a partner with them. This will help you to win customer confidence.  Despite having some bandwidth, I have never seen you coming to me for any additional work or initiatives.  

4.	Technical Expertise: Please work on upscaling you in DevOps area & technology. 

Please work on all these pointers in coming days and lets have a review in next 2 weeks. 


Thanks,
Amit
